Welcome to our repository! In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of setting up and remotely connecting your Git project with GitHub. Follow these steps to seamlessly manage your project, commit changes, and push updates to your GitHub repository.


Step 1: Initialize Git Repository


Begin by initializing a new Git repository in your project folder. Use the following command:git init


This creates a hidden .git folder in your project, indicating that it's now a Git repository.


Step 2: Add and Commit Changes


Add your project files to the staging area using:git add .


Commit the changes with a descriptive message:git commit -m"first commit for Lab_2"


Step 3: Create a GitHub Repository


If you haven't created a repository on GitHub yet, do so now. If you have, you can skip this step.


step 4: create python file git add kunal_krishan_sharma_model_v1.ipynb


Step 5: Add GitHub Remote


Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin:git remote add origin https://github.com/kunalkrishan19/AIDI_2004_Lab_2_100938687.git


Step 6: Create and Switch Branch


Create a new branch for your work: git branch lab2_new_file


git checkout lab2_new_file


Step 7: git commit -m "this is my second model file" image


Step 8: git push origin lab2_new_file 


If you've set up the branch previously, you can use: git push origin lab2_new_file
